# octomap_small_time
  Traditional octomaps, due to the accumulation of point clouds, can cause noticeable lag on some lower-performance computers. We have modified the code to make the point cloud representation of obstacles in the octomap single-frame.The specific configuration process is as follows:
  1.sudo apt-get install ros-noetic-octomap*
  2.mkdir octomap_ws
  3.cd octomap_ws
  4.mkdir src
  5.
